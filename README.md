'Advanced' Custom ListView
===============================
This is a simple project that demonstrates how you can click on a item on a custom list and perform
a task. I will be using RecyclerView and ViewHolder pattern in the ListAdapter class. It's a simple
hack to an issue that has been bugging me.

This projects' core concept is borrowed from [AndroidHives CustomListView](http://www.androidhive.info/2014/07/android-custom-listview-with-image-and-text-using-volley/) .
I added the AddMovie functionality which allows you to click on the Add button on a listItem.
